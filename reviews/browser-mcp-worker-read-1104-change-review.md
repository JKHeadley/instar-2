# Change review — worker reads connector launch configuration

Subject base: bcbe1def1642146c18f1e0d569ab84016fa6454e
Review state: open
Reviewed content: none
Outcome: Grant the worker read access to the generated MCP launch configuration before its continuing session starts and expose the owner browser tool with an Anthropic-compatible input schema. Keep the configuration owned by the operator and read-only to the worker. Regenerate the source-pinned register against the committed repair.
Affected rules: 31, 63, 74, 78, 95, 101, 103, 111, 113, 116
Affected floors: secrets — only the already redacted launch file is readable, not credential custody; spend cap — unchanged; stop — unchanged; no duplicate sends — no new effect path; durable intake — unchanged.
Operator questions: none
Suggested tier: critical
Declared tier: critical
Tier rationale: This repairs a worker account access boundary used by the signed-in browser connector. It requires a real worker-account test, full exact-head gate, independent review, and copy trial before live use.
Side effects: The harness worker can read the generated MCP launch file for its own session. It cannot edit that file or read the owner browser profile.
Undo and recovery: Keep live 47b9c823 serving until the corrected build proves a real signed-in multi-step browser task. Restore that live build if the later switch fails.
Multi-machine posture: This is the existing macOS harness account ACL on the local generated file; no remote credential or profile copy.
Layer below: A real copy produced an MCP file with owner_github but the worker account could not read it. The adjacent admission file was readable. The added test uses sudo as the worker to read the exact launch file and fails when the ACL line is removed. After that repair, a second real copy reached Claude but its MCP log said it skipped observe because the schema used top-level oneOf. The server already checks the exact page/pages request. The native client test now rejects top-level oneOf, and a real copy must show the tool and complete the signed-in two-page task. The seven generated register files changed only to pin the new committed source and its derived digest.
1.x reference: A 1.x session runs as the machine owner and can read its own browser connector configuration. The separate 2.0 worker account needs this narrow read grant to reach the same connector.

Decision: MCP-READ-1104-1 | Grant read-only ACL only on the generated MCP file at launch, rather than giving the worker access to the owner profile or shared temp directory. | reported=/Users/dabombstudio/.instar/agents/echo/.instar/lanes/SEAM-LEDGER.md
Decision: MCP-READ-1104-2 | Commit the source repair before regenerating source-pinned register outputs, then cover both commits in this record. | reported=/Users/dabombstudio/.instar/agents/echo/.instar/lanes/SEAM-LEDGER.md
Decision: MCP-SCHEMA-1104-3 | Remove top-level oneOf from the client-advertised input schema because Claude skipped the only tool; retain the existing server-side input validation. | reported=/Users/dabombstudio/.instar/agents/echo/.instar/lanes/SEAM-LEDGER.md



## Row 88 review invalidation

The b738936 frozen subject was intact before this unit. The generated register
publication now differs, so this round is explicitly reopened. Prior
browser evidence remains history, not approval of the combined head. Row 88
runtime/model changes and remaining gaps are described in
carryover-88-hub-binding-r2-1105-change-review.md; new independent review is required.

Prompt finding: 4106b49fff07 | protocol-literal | Existing session capability boundary describes observed tool availability, not an expected fixture answer. This change only adds a journal frame and does not alter that prompt.
Prompt finding: 849db3a6296a | protocol-literal | Existing empty-memory wording is conditional on the actual memory projection; the fixture quotes that governed-state branch. No prompt edit here.
Prompt finding: 85544c20941f | protocol-literal | Existing retained-input acknowledgement names actual custody, not a target answer supplied by this hub change.
Prompt finding: e8708c7fea24 | protocol-literal | Existing source-label grounding instruction is general and names uncertainty; it does not inject a test answer.
Skip: tests/preview/hub-recorded.test.ts:43 | scope=Private actual-provider recordings are supplied with INSTAR_HUB_CAPTURE_ROOT; absent evidence visibly skips, and never counts as recorded proof. This unit explicitly ran all six cases with hash-verified private bytes.

## Closing block

simplestRobustRoute: Use the existing harness ACL helper on the one generated file before a continuing session launches.
80/20: The worker can load the connector without changing owner profile custody. Real signed-in page reads still need copy proof before live release.
VERDICT: author submission; this record asserts no independent verdict.
